# Summary

The intra­-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model describes diffusion and perfusion in the signal acquired with diffusion (Le Bihan et al. 1986). MRI.​ Recently, the interest has expanded and applications have emerged throughout the body (Le Bihan 2008) including kidneys, ​liver, and even the heart (Powers, Lorenz, Holburn, Price 1991; Tsuda, Murakami, Sakurai, Harada, Kim, Takahashi, Tomoda, Narumi, Nakamura, Izumi, Tsukamoto 1997;  Callot, Bennett, Decking, Ulrich, Balaban, Wen, Han 2003). ​Many more applications are now under investigation such as imaging for cancer (prostate, liver, kidney, pancreas, etc.) (Koh, Collins, Orton 2011) and human placenta (Moore, Strachan, Tyler, Duncan, Baker, Worthington, Johnson, Gowland 2000; Moore Issa, Tokarczuk, Duncan, Boulby, Baker, Bowtell, Worthington, Johnson, Gowland 2000). ​One of its largest uses is in brain mapping​ and neuroscience research (Federau, Maeder, O'Brien, Browaeys, Meuli, Hagmann 2012) such as Parkinson’s disease (Cruz, Nie & Wang 2014) ​where it is used to study aging and ​structural degeneration of fibre pathways in the ​brain.
